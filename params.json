{"name":"Kyle Kolpek","tagline":"","body":"### About Me\r\nI have a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Kentucky](http://cs.uky.edu/). For the majority of my undergraduate career I worked under [Dr. Brent Seales](http://vis.uky.edu/about/people/faculty/brent-seales/), with most of my time being dedicated to the [EDUCE](http://vis.uky.edu/research/imaging/educe/) project, working to extract data from Herculaneum scrolls. Following that I worked as a research intern under [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/), working on the problem of aerial image stitching. \r\n### Projects\r\n**Ray Tracer**\r\n\r\nThis was the final project for CS535: Intermediate Computer Graphics. The requirements were to implement a ray tracer in software that was able to display spheres, triangles, and texture triangles using the Lambertian lighting model.\r\n\r\n![Scene 1](https://github.com/KyleKolpek/SimpleRayTracer/blob/master/images/scene1_25.png?raw=true)\r\n![Scene 2](https://github.com/KyleKolpek/SimpleRayTracer/blob/master/images/scene2_25.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**Tabletop Game Simulation**\r\n\r\nThis was a group project for CS499: Senior Design. It involved working with a customer to meet project requirements. There were four of us on the project, and we chose to create a game using modern [OpenGL](http://opengl.org) in order to better familiarize ourselves with the API. We worked to design, prototype, and finally implement what we could of the game.\r\n\r\n**2D Physics Demo**\r\n\r\nThis was my own project meant to serve as the basis for a 2D Game Engine. It never got that far, but I got the chance to familiarize myself with XNA and implement approximate Newtonian physics. I accomplished this using the Separating Axis Theorem to check collisions between convex objects.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8VWIHHGMlfg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8VWIHHGMlfg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n### Recommended Books/Resources\r\n* **[Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/), Jason L. McKesson. **\r\nThis is an e-book dedicated to teaching the basics of graphics programming to those with little to no experience. To accomplish this it uses the OpenGL API. I worked through most of it over the course of a winter break, and found it to be very well laid out, and I frequently recommend it to anyone who asks for an up to date resource for learning OpenGL.\r\n* **[Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://pbrt.org/), Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys.**\r\nThis book covers the topic of photo-realistic rendering in-depth. The content is presented in a code-centric fashion that easily relates theory to practice. I haven't gone through the entire book yet, but I have covered enough to appreciate the practicality that the authors approach the problem with.\r\n* **[3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](http://gamemath.com/), Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry.**\r\nDunn and Parberry made great effort to make this book as readable as possible. Thus, there are probably better reference materials available, but the book is wonderful at teaching the basics of the math behind the graphics pipeline.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
