I am currently employed as a research intern under [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/), working on the problem aerial image stitching. Previously I worked under [Dr. Brent Seales](http://vis.uky.edu/about/people/faculty/brent-seales/), with the majority of my time being dedicated to the [EDUCE](http://vis.uky.edu/research/imaging/educe/) project, working to extract data from Herculaneum scrolls.\r\n### Projects\r\n**Ray Tracer**\r\n\r\nThis was the final project for CS535: Intermediate Computer Graphics. The requirements were to implement a ray tracer in software that was able to display spheres, triangles, and texture triangles using the Lambertian lighting model.\r\n\r\n![Scene 1](https://github.com/KyleKolpek/SimpleRayTracer/blob/master/images/scene1_25.png?raw=true)\r\n![Scene 2](https://github.com/KyleKolpek/SimpleRayTracer/blob/master/images/scene2_25.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**Tabletop Game Simulation**\r\n\r\nThis was a group project for CS499: Senior Design. It involved working with a \"customer\" to meet project requirements. There were four of us on the project, and we chose to create a game using \"modern\" [OpenGL](http://opengl.org) in order to better familiarize ourselves with the API. We worked to design, prototype, and finally implement what we could of the game.\r\n\r\n**2D Physics Demo**\r\n\r\nThis was my own project meant to serve as the basis for a 2D Game Engine. It never got that far, but I got the chance to familiarize myself with XNA and implement approximate Newtonian physics. I accomplished this using the Separating Axis Theorem to check collisions between convex objects.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8VWIHHGMlfg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/8VWIHHGMlfg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n### Recommended Books\r\n* **[Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://pbrt.org/), Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys.**\r\nThis book covers the topic of photo-realistic rendering in-depth. The content is presented in a code-centric fashion that easily relates theory to practice.\r\n* **[3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](http://gamemath.com/), Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry.**\r\nDunn and Parberry made great effort to make this book as readable as possible. Thus, there are probably better reference materials available, but the book is wonderful at teaching the basics of the math behind the graphics pipeline.","google":""}
