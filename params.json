I am currently employed as a research intern under [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/), working on the problem aerial image stitching. Previously I worked under [Dr. Brent Seales](http://vis.uky.edu/about/people/faculty/brent-seales/), with the majority of my time being dedicated to the [EDUCE](http://vis.uky.edu/research/imaging/educe/) project, working to extract data from Herculaneum scrolls.\r\n\r\n### Recommended Books\r\n* **[Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://pbrt.org/), Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys.**\r\nThis book covers the topic of photo-realistic rendering in-depth. The content is presented in a code-centric fashion that easily relates theory to practice.\r\n* **[3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](http://gamemath.com/), Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry.**\r\nDunn and Parberry made great effort to make this book as readable as possible. Thus, there are probably better reference materials available, but the book is wonderful at teaching the basics of the math behind the graphics pipeline.\r\n","google":"","tagline":""}
